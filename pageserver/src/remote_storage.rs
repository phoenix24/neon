//! A set of generic storage abstractions for the page server to use when backing up and restoring its state from the external storage.
//! This particular module serves as a public API border between pageserver and the internal storage machinery.
//! No other modules from this tree are supposed to be used directly by the external code.
//!
//! There are a few components the storage machinery consists of:
//! * [`RemoteStorage`] trait a CRUD-like generic abstraction to use for adapting external storages with a few implementations:
//!     * [`local_fs`] allows to use local file system as an external storage
//!     * [`s3_bucket`] uses AWS S3 bucket as an external storage
//!
//! * synchronization logic at [`storage_sync`] module that keeps pageserver state (both runtime one and the workdir files) and storage state in sync.
//! Synchronization internals are split into submodules
//!     * [`storage_sync::index`] to keep track of remote tenant files, the metadata and their mappings to local files
//!     * [`storage_sync::upload`] and [`storage_sync::download`] to manage archive creation and upload; download and extraction, respectively
//!
//! * public API via to interact with the external world:
//!     * [`start_local_timeline_sync`] to launch a background async loop to handle the synchronization
//!     * [`schedule_timeline_checkpoint_upload`] and [`schedule_timeline_download`] to enqueue a new upload and download tasks,
//!       to be processed by the async loop
//!
//! Here's a schematic overview of all interactions backup and the rest of the pageserver perform:

//!
//! First, during startup, the pageserver inits the storage sync thread with the async loop, or leaves the loop uninitialised, if configured so.
//! The loop inits the storage connection and checks the remote files stored.
//! This is done once at startup only, relying on the fact that pageserver uses the storage alone (ergo, nobody else uploads the files to the storage but this server).
//! Based on the remote storage data, the sync logic immediately schedules sync tasks for local timelines and reports about remote only timelines to pageserver, so it can
//! query their downloads later if they are accessed.
//!
//! Some time later, during pageserver checkpoints, in-memory data is flushed onto disk along with its metadata.
//! If the storage sync loop was successfully started before, pageserver schedules the new checkpoint file uploads after every checkpoint.
//! The checkpoint uploads are disabled, if no remote storage configuration is provided (no sync loop is started this way either).
//! See [`crate::layered_repository`] for the upload calls and the adjacent logic.
//!
//! Synchronization logic is able to communicate back with updated timeline sync states, [`crate::repository::TimelineSyncStatusUpdate`],
//! submitted via [`crate::tenant_mgr::apply_timeline_sync_status_updates`] function. Tenant manager applies corresponding timeline updates in pageserver's in-memory state.
//! Such submissions happen in two cases:
//! * once after the sync loop startup, to signal pageserver which timelines will be synchronized in the near future
//! * after every loop step, in case a timeline needs to be reloaded or evicted from pageserver's memory
//!
//! When the pageserver terminates, the sync loop finishes a current sync task (if any) and exits.
//!
//! The storage logic considers `image` as a set of local files (layers), fully representing a certain timeline at given moment (identified with `disk_consistent_lsn` from the corresponding `metadata` file).
//! Timeline can change its state, by adding more files on disk and advancing its `disk_consistent_lsn`: this happens after pageserver checkpointing and is followed
//! by the storage upload, if enabled.
//! Yet timeline cannot alter already existing files, and cannot remove those too: only a GC process is capable of removing unused files.
//! This way, remote storage synchronization relies on the fact that every checkpoint is incremental and local files are "immutable":
//! * when a certain checkpoint gets uploaded, the sync loop remembers the fact, preventing further reuploads of the same state
//! * no files are deleted from either local or remote storage, only the missing ones locally/remotely get downloaded/uploaded, local metadata file will be overwritten
//! when the newer image is downloaded
//!
//! Pageserver maintains similar to the local file structure remotely: all layer files are uploaded with the same names under the same directory structure.
//! Yet instead of keeping the `metadata` file remotely, we wrap it with more data in [`IndexShard`], containing the list of remote files.
//! This file gets read to populate the cache, if the remote timeline data is missing from it and gets updated after every successful download.
//! This way, we optimize S3 storage access by not running the `S3 list` command that could be expencive and slow: knowing both [`ZTenantId`] and [`ZTimelineId`],
//! we can always reconstruct the path to the timeline, use this to get the same path on the remote storage and retrive its shard contents, if needed, same as any layer files.
//!
//! By default, pageserver reads the remote storage index data only for timelines located locally, to synchronize those, if needed.
//! Bulk index data download happens only initially, on pageserer startup. The rest of the remote storage stays unknown to pageserver and loaded on demand only,
//! when a new timeline is scheduled for the download.
//!
//! NOTES:
//! * pageserver assumes it has exclusive write access to the remote storage. If supported, the way multiple pageservers can be separated in the same storage
//! (i.e. using different directories in the local filesystem external storage), but totally up to the storage implementation and not covered with the trait API.
//!
//! * the sync tasks may not processed immediately after the submission: if they error and get re-enqueued, their execution might be backed off to ensure error cap is not exceeded too fast.
//! The sync queue processing also happens in batches, so the sync tasks can wait in the queue for some time.
